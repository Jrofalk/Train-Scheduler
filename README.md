# Train-Scheduler

<p>This is an application that allows an "administrator" to add the name, destination, time, and arrival frequency of a train and in return receive the next arrival time and minutes away of that train. The application uses a Firebase database to hold administrator data. The next arrival time and minutes away are calculated with the assistance of Moment.js</p>
